Test Repository


This is just a test, nothing to see here... please move along.

So, I'm to understand that anything I commit/publish to this repository is publicly available (unless I pay for the service) and anyone can access my code?  Hmmm... Maybe not what I was looking for.

I had a different idea of what github was and did. If I understand correctly, it is a public file versioning service for developers to work together on projects.
